#Rmd Notes

Label all your chunks uniquely and don't use "." or ":" in your chunk names. "-" is ok.
So foo-foo and foo:foo are ok and foo.foo is not

Label chapters like with 'chap-' and a tag specific to that chapter
# Foo Chapter {#chap-foo}

Label sections like with 'sec-' and a tag specific to that chapter
# This is a section {#sec-foo-this-section}



#Rnw Notes
Label all your chunks uniquely and don't use "." or ":" in your chunk names. "-" is ok.
So foo-foo and foo:foo are ok and foo.foo is not

all chapter, section and subsection labels need to be on same line as \chapter or \section or next line
This ->
\chapter{Number 1} \label{chap:number1}
Or ->
\chapter{Number 1}
\label{chap:number1}

If you put the label after \chapter or \section, then label should be by itself on a line. So don't do this ->
\label{chap:number1} And now I start my chapter. Yada, yada.

Chapter labels should be of the form with the "chap:" prefix
chap:foo
Section and subsection labels should be of the form with the "sec:" prefix
sec:foo

Why? Because rmarkdown uses different ref formats for sections and I need to know what kind of \label this is.

all equations that will be numbered need a label

\verb@foo@ will put foo in r code so will be shaded
\texttt{foo} will make foo as courier font

If you make a plot, but don't want it plotted, use fig=FALSE even if you have eval=FALSE

cross-refs for figures are automatically generated from the chunk label.  If chunk is foo, then ref is fig:foo.
example:
\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
<<foo, fig=TRUE>>=
plot(1,1)
@
\end{center}
\caption{Correlogram of the observed atmospheric CO$_2$ concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawai'i obtained with the function \texttt{plot.acf}.}
\end{figure}

This is Figure \ref{fig:foo}.

chunk labels should have either of the two formats
<<foo, #no space between <<, label, and ","
or
<<label=foo, #no space between <<label=, label, and ","


If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, please make sure the chunk label only contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-).
