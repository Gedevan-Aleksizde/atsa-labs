These are computer labs developed as part of a course we teach at the University of Washington on applied time series analysis for fisheries and environmental data.  You can find our lectures on our course website \url{https://nwfsc-timeseries.github.io/atsa/}.  You can find our initial labs in the MARSS User Guide.
 
The authors are research scientists at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC).  This work was conducted as part of our jobs at the NWFSC, a research center for NOAA Fisheries which is a United States federal government agency.
